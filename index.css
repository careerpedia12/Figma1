    <!-- <h1>Anime</h1>
        <p>Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ) (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.</p>

           <p> The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.[2]</p>
           <h3>Precusers</h3>
           <p>Emakimono and shadow plays (kage-e) are considered precursors of Japanese animation.[19] Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left in chronological order, as a moving panorama.[19] Kage-e was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadow plays of China.[19] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.[19] The paper play called kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s.[19] Puppets of the Bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animation.[19] Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.[19]</p>
           <h3>Pioneers</h3>
           <p>Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[20] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin (c. 1907),[21] a private work by an unknown creator.[22] In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana.[23] Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.[24]</p>
